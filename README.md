# Hi there, I’m Vira

Data Science and AI enthusiast on a mission to turn raw data into insight… and maybe occasionally into coffee.  

I come from a higher education universe, where I led research projects involving data modeling, machine learning, and performance analysis. Now, I’m navigating a transition to a data analyst role, ready to use my analytical superpowers to solve real-world business problems (and maybe make Excel spreadsheets look cool).  

I hold a PhD in Computer Science, armed with strong analytical and statistical skills, and a slightly obsessive curiosity about data.
